I've been failing at adwords recently. So I approached Karl who runs [Online
Expression][online-expression] and after a quick sit-down these are the
mind-blowing tips he revealed.

### Search Network only - All features

Under `Campaign > Settings` make sure that `All features` is selected. I had
it set to `Standard` which meant that a lot of the goodies below never showed
up.

### Ad Rotation

If you're starting out, you'll want to have a fair gauge of how well each
individual ad is doing. Problem is Google will give ads that it thinks will
work well a higher weighting. Under `Campaign > Settings > Advanced Settings`
choose `Rotate evenly: Show ads more evenly for at least 90 days, then
optimise`.

### Search terms report

This is not easy to find. Go to `Campaign > Keywords > Details > Search Terms`
to get a list of _actual terms_ people used that triggered your ads.

### Quality score

Quality score columns are hidden by default. Use `Campaign > Keywords >
Columns > Customize Columns` to enable them. Although a quality score of 4/10
still shows as 'in the green' in adwords, I've been told that we need to
strive for a minimum of 7/10.

An effective way to increase your quality score for your ads, is to make sure
that the ad includes keywords that it's targeting in it's ad text. This
_excludes_ synonyms. This may seem obvious, but if your keyword was `wedding
registry`, and you had `bridal registry` in your ad, it is _not_ considered
relevant adtext.

### Any more?
